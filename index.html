          <p class="profile-title">Supervisor of Dining Operations</p>
          <p>Jean went to school at Johnson & Wales and Rivier College and came to Brown right after graduating.  She has been here ever since.  She wakes up at 4am every day to get to Brown and start work. In regard to her daily routine and the people she works with she says, “every morning I enjoy getting up. We all care about each other- it’s like a second family.”</p>

          <p class="profile-title">Assistant Director for Residential Dining</p>
          <p>Bobby started working in contract health care before working here, and so he appreciates the longevity of the workers at Brown. “I would encourage students to take tours of the Ratty to learn about what goes on behind-the-scenes, to see the quality and freshness of the food. We have our own baker shop and butcher shop, which is pretty unique among colleges. People don’t realize it, but Brown has such an impressive sustainability initiative and sources quality ingredients from local farmers.”</p>
